# Game-Engine
Creation of a Swing-based Java game engine.

In order to keep my skills sharp over the summer, I am building this library, which can be used to easily make Java-based
games and animations. I am utilizing the MVC design, which are separated into packages GameModel, GameView, and GameController.
Additional design patterns are utilized throughout the code, such as the Observer pattern to synchronize game speeds and handle game
tasks.
