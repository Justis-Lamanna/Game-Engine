/**
 * Keeps track of each Paintable's properties.
 * <p>The basics of a Paintable implementation are good enough for
 * general painting, but unsuitable for more specialized applications.
 * While the Paintable methods keep track of a Paintable object's X-Y position
 * and appearance, this class adds more methods, which are more directly
 * tied to the ViewMode, such as priority and display flags.
 * <p>All setter methods in this class return the instance of this class, in
 * order to "build" the sprite. This permits you to configure a sprite like this:
 * {@code mode.addSprite(0, 0, "Resources/spr0.png").setWrapped(true).setTransparentRGB(Color.BLACK);}
 * <p>Fields are detailed here:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Paintable - The Paintable this PaintProperties wraps. It includes what
 * the sprite looks like, as well as its X-Y position.</li>
 * <li>Priority - The height of the Paintable. This value, floored, represents
 * the sprite layer to be painted on. Within other Paintables of this layer,
 * Paintables are painted from lower priority to higher priority, with higher
 * priorities overwriting lower priorities.</li>
 * <li>Visibility - Whether this Paintable should be shown or hidden from view.
 * By default, this is true.</li>
 * <li>Wrap - Whether this Paintable should be clipped to the screen size, or
 * wrap around the screen to the other side. By default, this is false.</li>
 * <li>Background Color - The color of the Paintable's background. It is easier
 * to create Paintables, and designate some color as the "transparent" color.
 * This color is essentially ignored when it is encountered during screen render.
 * By default, this is the color of the top-left pixel.</li>
 * <li>Semitransparency - A flag, saying this Paintable is semitransparent. The
 * process of blending two images is somewhat complicated, and may be more
 * time-consuming than absolutely necessary. Setting this flag to false removes
 * the calculation, and does a straight painting operation. By default, this is
 * true.</li>
 * </ul>
