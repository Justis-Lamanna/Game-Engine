/**
 * Test ViewMode.
 * <p>This ViewMode is used to test out the use of MatrixFunction in conjunction
 * with ImageOp.apply(). This transforms the image provided into something
 * to emulate a simple perspective. The top line of pixels is shrunk by 50%,
 * the middle line of pixels is kept the same size, and the bottom line of
 * pixels is expanded by 50%. The image is rotated before applying this
 * perspective transform, to make it seem as if you're looking around the
 * image from above.
 * <p>Mode 7 is complex stuff. The best solution, rather than the one provided
 * here, would be to develop an equation which would take the viewer's X-Y-Z
 * position, as well as their roll, pitch, and yaw, and convert it into
 * the appropriate positioning. This would allow you to have complete control
 * over the "camera", although it may be out of the scope of your needs.
