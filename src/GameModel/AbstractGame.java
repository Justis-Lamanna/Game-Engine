/**
 * A skeleton to facilitate game creation.
 * <p>Most importantly, this class utilizes GameTasks to create game logic.
 * On each call to onFrame(), which is typically done by the GameMode, each
 * task is iterated through, one after the next. Tasks can be assigned a name, 
 * which can then be used in place of the task
 * when methods require a task parameter.
 * <p>Like in the Mode0 class, this internally gives each task its own
 * priority and disable flag. GameTasks with lower priorities are executed
 * before tasks of higher priority. Additionally, a priority range may be
 * set; This would execute all tasks lower than or equal to some priority,
 * and ignore all others. Between tasks of equal priority, the most recent
 * addition will be executed before later ones. Due to the nature of comparing
 * doubles, NaN is the highest value possible.
 * <p>Utilizing organized priorities can help game creation run smoothly. Generally,
 * things like playing sound would have a very high priority, so sound will
 * never cease playing due to a priority bound. Animations may have a high
 * priority as well; oftentimes animations need to play and finish before other
 * tasks are taken care of, so the priority bound could be used to halt everything
 * except animation, sound, and any other important tasks.
